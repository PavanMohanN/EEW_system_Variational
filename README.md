## Overview

This repository contains code for an earthquake early warning system based on a conditional variational autoencoder (VAE). The system is designed to predict 27 spectral accelerations using 8 input variables: Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA), Peak Ground Displacement (PGD), Predominant Frequency (Fp), 5-95% Significant Duration  (Tsig), Arias Intensity (Ia), Cumulative Absolute Velocity  (CAV), Site Class ($S_c$), and direction flag (dir).
